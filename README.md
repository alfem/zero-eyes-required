==================

Using just your voice, and a little help from Google, you can play quiz games!

This is a very first version of a simple quiz game that you can play on a small computer (Raspberry Pi, netbook...). 

It does not need a screen, only speakers and a microphone. 

Start the game, say the names of the players and wait for the computer to ask questions. Then, answer just talking to the microphone.

My first language is spanish, so it is possible that some defaults in this early version are set in that language, but you can change them easily.
